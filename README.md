## Before the Cloud 
Example 1 - Online Shopping APP
* Challenge: 
  * Peak usage during holidays and weekends
  * Less load during rest of the time
* Solution (before the Cloud):
  * Procure (Buy) infrastructure for peak load
    * the infrastructure would be idling during period of low loads

Example 2 - Startup
* Challenge:
  * It suddenly becomes popular
  * How to handle the sudden increase in load
* Solution (before the Cloud):
  * Procure (Buy) infrastructure assuming they would be successful
    * what if they are not successful

Challenges before the Cloud:
  * High costs of procuring infrastructure
  * Needs ahead of time planning (hard to predict the future)
  * Low infrastructure utilization
  * Dedicated infrastructure maintenance team (Startup usually can not afford)

## Silver lining in the Cloud
On-demand resource provision - also called Elasticity
* Advantages:
  * Trade "capital expense" for "variable expense"
  * Benefit from massive economies of scale
  * Stop guessing capacity
  * Increase speed and agility
  * Stop spending money running and maintaining data centers
  * "Go global" in minutes
